					<td colspan="9"><span>企业家将可能付诸实践，将想法转化为产品，把愿望变成现实。这些当然是通过具体的商业流程做到的，但是说服，论证，逻辑和沟通（书面和口头形式）也是至关重要的。企业家必须识别关键的市场问题与合适的解决方案，并分析它们是如何以产品，服务或平台的形式来创造新颖的的经济机会。这种“适合财务影响”是一种价值主张。价值主张必须进一步针对那些可能购买，销售，导流，支持或分销产品或服务的特定受众。该过程需要企业家和市场利益相关方之间的深入合作，以共同创造具有经济回报的价值主张。学生将使用创业故事板沟通他们的创新理念，这在商业合作交流上是一个具有说服力的修辞工具。整个课堂将基于科学理论并为价值和业务扩展开发具有说服力的论据。</span></td>

					<th class="pkuportal-td-title" width="10%">英文简介</th>
					<td colspan="9"><span>Entrepreneurs turn the possible into practice; ideas into products; aspirations into reality. This is done certainly through business processes – but persuasion, argumentation, logic and communication (written and oral forms) are also critical. Entrepreneurs must identify key market problems and fit solutions that create innovative economic opportunities in the form of products, services or platforms. This “fit with financial implication” is a value proposition. Value propositions must be further tailored to a specific audience who may buy, sell, channel, champion or distribute the product or service. The process requires deep engagement between entrepreneurs and market stakeholders in order to co-create value propositions that produce financial return. Students will engage their innovative idea using the Entrepreneurial Storyboard, a persuasive, rhetorical tool for business partnership communication. The class will apply theory and develop persuasive arguments for value and business expansion. </span></td>
