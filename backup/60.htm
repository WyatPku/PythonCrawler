					<td colspan="9"><span><br>Centered upon philosophical developments and philosophical-political debates in the P.R. China established in 1949, this course aims to explore the complicated intertwined relationship between philosophy and politics in New China. Our main emphasis will be on the philosophical-political works by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Ai Siqi, Yang Xianzhen, Feng Youlan, Wang Hui, and other notable Chinese theoreticians, and on the heated controversies over epistemology, dialectics, materialism and political philosophy. We will of course probe the historical and political context and consequences of those philosophical disputes and positions. We will also discuss diverse views on those issues by famous Western critics, such as Louis Althussser, Alain Badiou, Slavoj Zizek and Alessandro Russo. Related movies, documentaries and videos will be screened in class to illustrate corresponding historical backgrounds and philosophical-political issues.<br></span></td>
