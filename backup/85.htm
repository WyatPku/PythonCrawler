					<td colspan="9"><span>As a time-honored genre, poetry enjoyed an unrivalled status in classical Chinese literature. This course offers a survey of classical Chinese poetry by studying its evolution from about the 11th century B.C to the 12th century AD, when poetry had almost passed the zenith of its development. We shall study its two major forms — Shi poetry &amp; Ci poetry (song lyrics) — and examine their various modes by focusing on the most representative works in history, particularly by ten major poets, with due attention to their distinctive life experience and the cultural context of each poem. By the end of the term, students will be enabled to cultivate their capacity for independent appreciation and to catch a glimpse of the breadth, depth and wealth of classical Chinese poetry. &nbsp;<br>This is a lecture/seminar-combined class. On class days, when a new genre or poet is being introduced, I will introduce at the very beginning some relevant historical and cultural background information, followed by students’ discussion. Generally, we focus on one genre/poet for each session. All the study materials will be in English. I shall find the best translations available, sometimes along with the Chinese original and relevant audio readings. We shall also read some poems by non-Chinese poets, such as Coleridge, Browning, Dickinson, Frost, Bishop, Szymborska, etc. We believe such comparative lens will help us discern both the merits as well as the weaknesses of Chinese poetry. Students are required to read the assignments (including poems and essays) in advance and come to class fully prepared for discussion. </span></td>
