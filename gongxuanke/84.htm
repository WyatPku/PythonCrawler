<br>Based on a philosophy that effective learning hinges not only upon teacher-student interaction, but also upon inter-student interaction, this course will be carried out in a variety of forms. Besides lectures offered by the instructor, students are encouraged to engage in class discussions, learning from each other and self-learning. Hence, there will be some team projects like presentations on some case studies and debates.<br>1)	Presentation: Throughout the course, students are required to present some topics. For topic presentation, students may be divided into different groups (depending on the no. of students), each responsible for one topic. Students in the same group need to make joint efforts to make well preparation for their presentations. <br>2)	For the memo, each student is expected to write a short one (1-2 pages) for 2-3 times, which briefly summarizes and critiques required texts for a particular session. The students are also required to brief the memo in the corresponding class in a concise way. For any query, students are encouraged to approach the instructor. <br>Memos and presentations will count toward final grades. The students who prepare memos and presentations should circulate the memos and PPT slides to other students and the instructor before class. Topic presentation should be around 15-18 minutes, followed by class discussion. Students’ performance in debates, memos and presentations will be counted. <br>3)	Debates: students will be divided into two groups<br>Students are expected to complete all required readings prior to class meetings and to actively participate in class discussion.
