					<td colspan="9"><span>The rise of China is one of the most important and defining themes in contemporary international relations and world politics. This seminar course is intended for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students to explore the complexities of major academic and real-world issues and topics concerning the rise of China by analyzing divergent perspectives and engaging in the relevant academic discourse and policy debate about implications of China’s rise for world politics. The seminar is organized around the central question – will China’s rise bring about a fundamental change to the international system? The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) China’s rise and the paradigm change in world politics; (2) China’s quest for identity and order; and (3) challenges and implications of China rising for Asia and the world. Under each of these sections, a few specific topics are identified for class discussion.
<br>Texts<br>There are both required and recommended readings for each class. No book purchase needed. All the required texts (those highlighted in bold) will be available through PKU Summer School arrangements. <br><br>Session 1<br>Introduction: The Rise of China and Its Implications for World Politics <br>Session 2<br>Contending Paradigms in World Politics<br>Memo and Presentation I <br>Session 3<br>China’s Reemergence as a World Power: East Asia as a Distinct International System?<br>Memo and Presentation II <br>Session 4<br>A World in the Image of Tianxia (天下)<br>Memo and Presentation III<br>Session 5<br>China’s Quest for Modern Identity<br>Memo and Presentation IV <br>Session 6<br>The Revival of Confucianism: Identity and Modernity <br>Memo and Presentation V<br>Session 7<br>Is Culture Destiny?

<br>Participation and discussion constitute a central part in this course. Attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to complete all required readings prior to class meetings and to actively participate in class discussion. Absence without legitimate reasons will lead to deduction in scores for participation and discussion, and in extreme cases, may lead to a student’s failure in the course.<br><br>The proceeding of the course will be based on students’ presentation of the required texts related to the general themes and specific topics. Throughout the course, each student is expected to write a short memo (1-2 pages) 1-3 times (depending on the number of student enrollment) which briefly summarizes and critiques required texts for a particular session. Memos and presentations will count toward scores in participation. The students who prepare memos should circulate the memos to other students and the instructor before class, and each make a 5-7 minute presentation in class, which is followed by class discussion.
<br>Evaluation <br><br>Three parts of the evaluation will be calculated as follows:<br><br>Participation and discussion	Presentation and critique	Paper(s)<br>40%	15%	45%
