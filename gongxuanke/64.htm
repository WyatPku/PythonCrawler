Specific topics covered will include developing great power rivalry in Asia; inter-state and intra-state conflicts; maritime security; a range of so-called `non-traditional` and `human security` challenges, including transitional crime, economic security and terrorism issues; and the role of regional institutions such as ASEAN, the ARF, APEC and the East Asian Summit in addressing current security issues. These will be examined within the overall idea of ‘regionalism’, meaning whether the Asia-Pacific is developing as a specific security region in the international system. <br><br>Current theories of international security, including schools of realism and liberalism but also newer approaches such as critical theory, will be used to explain trends in the study of security issues in the region. <br><br> <br><br><br></span></td>

<br>Proceeding of the Course<br>Participation and discussion will constitute a central part in this course. Attendance is mandatory, and students are expected to complete all required readings prior to class meetings and to actively participate in class discussion. Absence without legitimate reasons will lead to deduction in scores for participation and discussion. <br><br>The proceeding of the course will be based on students’ presentation of the required readings related to the general themes and specific topics. Throughout the course, each student is expected to write a short memo (1-2 pages) 1-3 times (depending on the number of student enrollment), which briefly summarizes and critiques required texts for a particular session. Memos and presentations will count toward scores in participation. The students who prepare memos should circulate the memos to other students and the instructor before class, and each make a 5-7 minute presentation in class, which is followed by class discussion. <br><br>Assignments (paper or other forms)<br>There are two options about writing assignments for this course. The first option is to write two short response papers (3-4 pages each, double-spaced and typed with 12-point font) on the required readings for two particular class periods. The second option is to write one longer analytical paper (12 pages, double-spaced and typed with 12-point font) on a topic that is relevant for the study of Asian Security, and that should focus on one or more specific issues or topics of this course. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Papers do require research on primary sources, but they should be associated with the assigned texts and other relevant literature. <br>The two short papers are each due by Friday, 17 July, and Friday, 31 July. Students who choose to write a longer paper/project should determine their topics in consultation with the instructor by the end of the first week and should submit the papers by Monday, 2 August. No late submission will be accepted unless a legitimate reason is presented to the instructor at least three days in advance. If students have questions concerning how to pick up a topic and/or how to write paper(s), please consult with the instructor.
<br>Evaluation Details<br>Three parts of the evaluation will be calculated as follows:<br>Participation and discussion 40%<br>Presentation and critique 15%	<br>Paper(s) 45%<br><br>Texts<br>There are no textbooks for this class, and instead there will be assigned weekly readings as well as recommended articles for background research. <br><br>Academic Integrity (If necessary)<br>Participation in this class commits the students and instructor to abide by a general norm of equal opportunity and academic integrity. It implies permission from students to submit their written work to services that check for plagiarism if required. It is the responsibility of the students to familiarise themselves with the definition of plagiarism. Violations of the norm of academic integrity will be firmly dealt with in this class.
