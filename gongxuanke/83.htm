It combines theoretical analysis with factual introduction, with the aim of enabling students to be quickly familiar with constitutional issues in China. Two theoretical questions will be asked throughout the course: 1. What is the relationship between law and political regime in China? 2. How do we understand the gap between law on paper and rule in reality in China? Guided by these two central questions, this course roughly breaks into three sections: 1. How do we read China’s Constitution; 2) Constitutional law and political regime; 3) Constitution and political reform. Under each section, a few sub-topics are to be specified. &nbsp;</span></td>

<br>Proceeding of the Course
<br>Students are expected to complete required readings prior to class and actively participate in class discussion. Each student has to write at least one memo (depending on the number of student enrollment) which briefly summarizes what has been lectured and discussed during last class. The student who prepares the memo should circulate it to other students and the instructor before class, and give a presentation of about 10 minutes in class. 
<br>Texts
<br>There are both required and recommended readings for each class. No book purchase needed. All the required texts (those highlighted in bold) will be available through PKU Summer School arrangements.
<br>Evaluation Details
<br>Three parts of the evaluation will be calculated as follows:
<br>Participation and discussion 40%
<br>Presentation and critique 15%
<br>Paper(s) 45%
<br>
<br>
<br>Paper Assignments
<br>There are two options about writing assignments. The first option is to write two short critiques (3-4 pages each, double-spaced and typed with 12-point font) on the required readings under different sections of this course. The second option is to write one longer paper (12 pages, double-spaced and typed with 12-point font) on a topic that is relevant for this course. The longer paper should be analytic and have a central argument.
