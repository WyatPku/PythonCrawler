					<td colspan="9"><span>Using historical, cultural, and sociological documents and data, this course examines the cultural and political distinctiveness of what are arguably the three most important global players, the United States, the European Union, and the People’s Republic of China. The course explores the factors that to a lesser or greater extent shaped the rather different ways these powers define and think about themselves and their respective missions. In so doing, it traces the (mostly) socio-cultural assumptions that have played a formative role in both domestic and foreign policy and that still largely determine each player’s internal debates and sensitivities. <br><br>The course thus provides students with the historical and theoretical background on European, American, and Chinese thinking needed to understand these powers’ perspective on global developments and, more in particular, the rise of China. Students will examine and discuss China’s return to the world stage as well as the often conflicted Euro-American responses to that return.<br><br>This course will offer students an intensive but varied two-week program with lectures, workshops, and excursions. Students are expected to actively participate in the workshops, prepare a (group) presentation and write a paper. <br></span></td>
