					<td colspan="9"><span>An economically more powerful and confident China is exerting unprecedented influence on global affairs with its proactive diplomacy. To understand the sources of Chinese external behavior is essential to predict and respond to China’s international behavior. But the very nature of the structure of Chinese society and government has made this a difficult, if not impossible, task, albeit appealing. The saying that foreign policy making is a black box is more accurate in China than in many other countries. Aiming to open the black box of Chinese foreign policy making, this course tries to bridge foreign decision-making theories and Chinese foreign policy making practice to understand the major factors that shape Chinese foreign policy and how they exert their influences. These include: the impact of historical legacies, systematic constraints, personality and decision-making style of paramount leaders; evolving foreign policy making structure and changing bureaucratic process; fluid domestic politics; and the impact of the military, nationalism and public opinion on Chinese foreign policy. It will unveil how leaders coordinate domestic and international situations in foreign affairs as they always emphasize today. It intends to inform students of China’s external behavior and provide an analytical understanding of the dynamics of China’s foreign policy decision-making.<br><br></span></td>
