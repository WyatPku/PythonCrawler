					<td colspan="9"><span>This course summarizes some of the new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings, and organizes this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.<br>This course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery, generated by Big Historical Datasets, is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present ten specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery, using a data analytic approach. <br></span></td>
