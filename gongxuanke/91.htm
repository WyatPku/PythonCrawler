<br>This course is lecture/seminar-combined, and students’ participation and discussion are mandatory. The learning materials will be mostly in English, with the Chinese fiction in English translation and the film in Chinese with English subtitles. Students are expected to finish all the class assignments (including both fiction and film) in advance and come to class fully prepared for discussion. Generally, we will focus on one fiction/film for each session. On class days, the instructor will first present some relevant information of literary and cultural background, and then it will be followed by instructor’s leading questions, students’ discussion, and the comparative study of fiction/film. If possible, we will also cover some non-Chinese fiction/film, such as the literary works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, etc. We hope that such comparative lens could further enlarge students’ horizontal vision and enhance their cross-cultural awareness.
<br>1. Class assignments (including both fiction and film) for each session;<br>2. One journal entry (500 words) based on some discussion topics in class;<br>3. Group presentation (3-5 minutes for each student) focusing on a literary/film term;<br>4. One final paper (1000 words) written on the fiction/film covered throughout the summer.<br><br>1. Participation and Discussion (15%);<br>2. Journal Entry of 500 words (20%);<br>3. Group Presentation (15%);<br>4. Final Paper of 1000 words (50%).
